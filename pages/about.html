        <h3> Welcome to my life story </h3>
        <p>
            My name is Jimmy Huang. I am 22 years old, born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. Recently graduated from University at Buffalo with a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Computer Science.

        <h4> Achieving my passion </h4>
        <p>
            Everything started at a very early age, I can barely remember when. It had to be sometime around 13 years old. It first started with creating game servers for Counter Strike, which then lead to Garry’s mod and soon Maple Story. There were a few plugin codes for Garry’s mod that I would fiddle around with, but Maple story was the first time I got into actual programming with the java language. At the same time I learned to set up servers from scratch, manage databases and work with websites. This was also around the time I built my first computer. Soon after I mainly worked with coding websites and setting up forums and blogs. Finally I am in college and graduate with my computer science degree.

        <h4> Why code </h4>
        <p>
            Why do I code? When I finish a code I feel accomplished that I just made something that was once only in my mind. When I am coding I really get into it, espically when it is something that isn't going as planned. I know it can be done and I won't stop intill I figure it out. I can be coding for hours and not realize how much time has pass, each step foward in the code is a step forward in my excietment.

        <h4> Hobbies without code </h4> 
        <p>
            When I am not coding I like to enjoy the outdoors. Especially when there is a wide open field where I can just stare across and take in nature. Such activities like camping and hiking are truly enjoyable to me. But living in the city this is not always an option. So besides my enjoyment of peace and nature I really like to do exciting activities such as snowboarding, paintballing, airsofting and skydiving. There are others that I really like to try and will be something I will look forward to. Although I don't like to have my photo taken, I do enjoy taking photos when I have the chance. Other things I like to do is drive my car or ride my motorcycle around when I am free. Sometimes I would also go out and fly my drone that I put together, I do enjoy flying it but it was more enjoyable building it. I enjoy anything that is hands on where I put them together piece by piece.
